# movie-database-class

We have finished the database implementation. <br>
We have added all the functionality + the ability to play the trailer for each movie.

In order to have the functionality working you need to install additional libraries<br>
Go to settings/prefferences and choose Project Interpreter, click + and add these libraries: <br>
- beautifulsoup4 
- requests
- pytube3
